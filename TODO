Improve WindowsHandler class

features:
 - profiler for benchmarking and optimization
 - no multithreading (first optimise in monothread and THEN we pump that shit up)

optimizations :
 - Chunk-based storage (32x32x32 ?)			=> obviously
 - Greedy meshing					=> hell yeah
 - Level of Details (LOD)				=> fuck yeah
 - Use OpenCL for meshing & OpenGL for rendering	=> to discuss but probably too convoluted
 - Multithread for LOD generation			=> not usefull and maybe buggy but cool idea
